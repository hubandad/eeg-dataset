## Event-related potential dataset



### ERP Core Dataset

ERP Core is an open source human ERP research project that covers paradigms and datasets commonly used in ERP research (6 ERP paradigms and 7 ERP components in total). One of the initiators of the project is Professor Steve Luck, whom we know well, and the main purpose of the project is to better advance ERP technology into social practice and to spread ERP technology for the benefit of humanity.

### OpenNeuro Dataset

OpenNeuro is a free and open source neuroimaging database sharing platform created by Poldrack and his team, providing a large number of MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, ECoG, ASL and PET datasets available for sharing. 540 publicly available As of today (May 2021), there are 540 publicly available datasets on OpenNeuro, and a total of 18,108 researchers have joined the platform to contribute to the database. Simply open OpenNeuro and search for relevant types of datasets by searching keywords (e.g., EEG) as needed, with no registration required. Today I am sharing with you an ERP dataset in OpenNeuro using the go / nogo detection and classification task. In this dataset, the authors have collected ERP data from 7 male and 7 female subjects each, and have also provided data analysis scripts and references.

### Epilepsy dataset



There are a few free and publicly available epilepsy datasets that can be collected on the internet, as many databases are part of the fee-based European Epilepsy Database (EED) project and need to be purchased separately.

The author has carefully searched and compiled the following small sample of epilepsy datasets as much as possible for your study and use.



**EEG sample data from 10 patients with epilepsy**


Data from epilepsy patients collected at the Neurology and Sleep Center in Hauz Khas, New Delhi, were based on a 10-20 distribution with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz in the MAT file. During the acquisition, the data were band-pass filtered in the range: 0.5 to 70 Hz and subdivided into pre-seizure, inter-seizure and seizure phases. Detailed information is available via txt text in the zip archive.

The dataset is available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308719109_EEG_Epilepsy_Datasets



**CHB-MIT scalp EEG database**


The database is collected from Boston Children's Hospital and includes EEG records from pediatric patients with intractable seizures. Detailed information can be found on the database web page.
